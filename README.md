# cl-6502, or The 6502...IBM 704 edition ;)

cl-6502 is a Common Lisp emulator, assembler and disassembler for the
[MOS 6502 processor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502).
In case that sounds weird to you, the MOS 6502 is famous for its use in...

* the [Apple II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series),
* the [original NES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System),
* the [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64),
* the [BBC Micro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro),
* and [Michael Steil's phenomenal talk](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2010/27c3-4159-en-reverse_engineering_mos_6502.html) at 27C3.

I gave a talk on cl-6502 and related ideas which is online [here](http://vimeo.com/47364930). The slides are available separately [here](http://redlinernotes.com/docs/talks/opa.html). A few notes on why I'm writing it are [here](http://blog.redlinernotes.com/posts/On-Interactive-Retrocomputing.html) and minor notes on the design are [here](http://blog.redlinernotes.com/posts/An-Emulator-Design-Pattern.html).

## Install
You are strongly encouraged to use this library via [Quicklisp](http://quicklisp.org/). Simply start your lisp and run: ```(ql:quickload 'cl-6502)```.

## Getting Started
* Check out the docs for the [*cl-6502*](http://redlinernotes.com/docs/cl-6502.html) package.
* Play around at the REPL!
* Use it to create your own wacky code artifacts.
* There is also a lower-level *6502* package if you really want to get your hands dirty. NOTE: The 6502 package shadows `BIT` and `AND` so you likely don't want to `:use` it in your own packages.

In particular, [asm](http://redlinernotes.com/docs/cl-6502.html#asm_func), [disasm](http://redlinernotes.com/docs/cl-6502.html#disasm_func), [execute](http://redlinernotes.com/docs/cl-6502.html#execute_func), [6502-step](http://redlinernotes.com/docs/cl-6502.html#6502-step_func), and [reset](http://redlinernotes.com/docs/cl-6502.html#reset_func) are likely of interest.

### A simple example:

1. Load cl-6502 and switch to the `cl-6502` package.
2. Write some 6502 code and run it through ```asm``` (e.g. ```(asm "brk")```) to get a bytevector to execute.
3. Load it into memory and run it with ```(execute *cpu* *my-bytevector*)``` OR
 1. Load it with ```(setf (get-range 0) *my-bytevector*)```
 2. Set the program counter to 0 with ```(setf (6502::cpu-pc *cpu*) 0)```
 3. Manually step through it with ```(6502-step *cpu* (get-byte (6502::immediate *cpu*)))```
4. ```(reset)``` the CPU as necessary and keep hacking! :)

### A note on supported Assembler syntax
The assembler supports comments, constants, and labels in addition to 6502 assembler code. There should only be one statement per line. A label stores the Program Counter, that is, the absolute address of the next instruction. Thus, ```loop: {newline} lda``` should store the absolute address of lda. If a label is used with a relative addressed instruction, it will be truncated as needed. Forward references, i.e. use of labels before their definition, are allowed. Instructions and register names are case insensitive; labels and constants names are case sensitive.

*Syntax Table*:
* Label definition: ```name:```
* Label usage: ```jmp !label``` where ! is the syntax of the desired addressing mode.
* Constant definition: ```name=val```
* Constant usage: ```lda !name``` where ! is the syntax of the desired addressing mode.
  * Labels and constants support: indirect, absolute, absolute-x, absolute-y, implied, and relative addressed instructions.
* Comments: ```foo ; a note about foo```
* Implied mode: ```BRK```
* Accumulator mode: ```ldx a```
* Immediate mode: ```lda #$00```
* Zero-page mode: ```lda $03```
* Zero-page-x mode: ```lda $03, x```
* Zero-page-y mode: ```ldx $03, y```
* Absolute mode: ```sbc $0001```
* Absolute-x mode: ```lda $1234, x```
* Absolute-y mode: ```lda $1234, y```
* Indirect mode: ```jmp ($1234)```
* Indirect-x mode: ```lda ($12), x```
* Indirect-y mode: ```lda ($34), y```
* Relative mode: ```bne &fd```

## Hacking

* Using Quicklisp: For local development, git clone this repository into the ```local-projects``` subdirectory of quicklisp.

To run the tests, after you've loaded *cl-6502* just run ```(asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op 'cl-6502)```. You may need to ```(ql:quickload 'cl-6502-tests)``` to ensure that the fiveam dependency is satisfied first. There is a dearth of tests at the moment but there will be more soon as the design has recently solidified.
