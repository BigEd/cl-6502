Audit opcodes for potential removal of RAW. SETF-FORM should solve this.
Investigate handling of negative numbers.
Write disassembler.
Find test programs.
MOAR UNIT TESTS! (opcodes+defopcode, addressing modes, helpers)

Ideas:
Define restarts for step?
-- Define the instruction.
-- Hand over a lambda to funcall/form to eval.
