MOAR UNIT TESTS! (opcodes+defopcode, addressing modes, helpers)
Fix Carry and Overflow handling. See 6502.txt.
Fix *benchmark* loop issue.
Improve the disassembler for browsing large ROMs. (i.e. Mega Man 2)
Find other example programs?

Ideas:
Define restarts for step?
-- Define the instruction.
-- Hand over a lambda to funcall/form to eval.
