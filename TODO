Audit opcodes for potential removal of RAW. SETF-FORM should solve this.
Investigate handling of negative numbers.
Write disassembler.
Find test programs.
MOAR UNIT TESTS! (opcodes+defopcode, addressing modes, helpers)

Ideas:
Define restarts for step?
-- Define the instruction.
-- Hand over a lambda to funcall/form to eval.
Have defopcode define a GF for opcode and THEN a bunch of methods with defins.
-- Better style.
-- Docs are "in the right place" as opposed to being duplicated in generated code.
-- This lets us do (documentation 'gf-name 'function) as opposed to:
--- (documentation (find-method ...) 'method) in the disassembler. MUCH nicer.
