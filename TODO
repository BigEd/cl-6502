Write the damn thing! Do the opcodes first.
Addressing modes should have helper functions in cpu.lisp and a keyarg to defins.
-- Implied is the default (nil).
Main loop after that, followed by disassembler+assembler?

;; OPCODES:
;; Write ORA tests.
;; Write tests for address modes!
;; Implement zero-page addressing for ora #x05.
;; Also, extend defins to handle more than one version for different addr-modes?
;; -- maybe make it a separate macro called defopcode?
;; Implement... ALL THE OPCODES!
;; Write tests for other CPU and RAM helpers. Objectify RAM?
