MOAR UNIT TESTS! (opcodes+macrology)
Improve the disassembler for browsing large ROMs. (i.e. Mega Man 2)
Find other example programs?

Ideas:
Turn ASM into a generic function.
-- Current definition becomes (asm STRING). Write (asm LIST). :)
Define restarts for step?
-- Define the instruction.
-- Hand over a lambda to funcall/form to eval.
